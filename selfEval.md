# Self Evaluation

- Reflect on your time management and awareness of where you spend time. Is this a strength or area you are working on? What support do you need in this area? And/or, what tips do you have to share with your classmates in this area?

-1. This is definitely an area that I am working on. I think I need support as to when to ask for help, when to go to the group, and when to consult online sources. I often find myself looking helplessly online and that contributes to unproductive struggle.

- How would you explain to a 5 year old what a function is?

2. A function is simply a set of instructions-- the function can print greetings, a grocery list, or even solve math problems such as addition or subtraction.

- Share your understanding of arguments and parameters.

3. the argument is the actual data that the function is going to return by utilizing the instructions to manipulate that data. parameters are defined in order to inform the call of the function, these must match the # of arguments in order to sucessfully call the function

- What questions/topics (related to Functions) do you want to being to your Small Group?

4. I think understanding the storing of a return value is a little hazy for me still
